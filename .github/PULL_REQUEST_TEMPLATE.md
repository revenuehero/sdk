## Description

<!--

Give a high level description of what this PR will solve. Did you need to refactor something? What tradeoffs did you take? Are there things in here which youâ€™d particularly like people to pay close attention to?

It could look something like this:

ex. Allowed the Form Component to support nested children, we need to parse all the children and store their attributes which makes the operation expensive. The nesting support hasn't been added to the FieldArray component, I've created separate tickets to handle that - REV-1234 & REV-5678.
